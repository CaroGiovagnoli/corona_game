# The Coronavirus Board game

> Based upon an idea from Florencia Giovagnoli. Estimated playing time: 30 minutos. Number of Players: your lockdown partners.    

### Game building elements:
- __Board__ an A3 size paper sheet, cardboard, plywood, or similar.    
- __To draw numbers__ colur pencils, magic markers, any writing element.    
- __Playing pieces__ Customized corks, buttons, anything you can use as.    
- __A dice__.    

### Making the board:
Draw a grid with 40 slots, and number them from 1 to 40.    

### Gameplay:
Every player chooses an avatar. 
The player who can do more “squat” sittings begins. 
 Roll the dice and go. Slot 18 is the supermarket / Grocery store. 
To get to the goal (slot 40) you have to draw the dice with the exact number of slots to it. Otherwise you bounce untill you make it.

### What happens in between:
- `+` __Slot 3:__ Lockdown begins, you make a schedule in order to survive homeoffice and homeschoolling chaos. Your cupboard is full of supplies and toilet paper, you´re highly motivated, roll the dice again.
- `-` __Slot 10:__ You got fever, 14 days isolation, you lose one turn.
- `+` __Slot 12:__ Out of toilet paper, go to the supermarket (Slot18).
- `-` __Slot 14:__ You went on a cruise with an infected passenger, lose two turns.
- `+` __Slot 15:__ Quarantine is driving you mad. Hold on plank position for 30 seconds, and move 4 slots.
- `+` __Slot 23:__ You ban yourself from school parents and friend's chats in order to avoid paranoid, move 5 slots.
- `-` __Slot 29:__ You read fake news a friend sent, tried to immunize your throat with hot lemon juice and got 2nd degree burns. Lose two turns.
- `-` __Slot 33:__ Out of toilet paper, go to the supermarket (Slot18).
- `-` __Slot 36:__ Tired of reading how is baking such a great activity during lockdown, you let yourself out to the store to get ingredients, and got caught by the police. Lose 1 turn. 
- `-` __Slot 39:__ You are infected and over 65 y.o. Luck is your only ally. Roll the dice, if it doesn't come out 8, you start over again from slot 1.

As usual, you can add your own.
